Money Tracker App
Relevant SDGs : SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being)

The finished product can serve as a tool that can be used to track income and expenses of its users. It will also be able to reveal the user as to how their money is used through informative graphs and tables so that the user can make better financial decisions in the future. This prototype will be a glimpse as to how such a tool may look like.
